Forecasting Retail Sales from year 1992-2020. The data has been downloaded from https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RSXFS.

Preparing the Data for EXPLORATION:
Knowing that there has been inflation in the last 25 years, I read in the Consumer Index Value(CPIAUCSL) to adjust for inflation.The whole series will be considered according to the 2020'$'rate.
This is an important step otherwise we would be considering the change in sales & change in inflation all wraped into one. Forecasting the future sales will then be according to the current dollar value rate.
